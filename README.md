# cse5234-Group7

This repository is an exploration into creating an e-commerce site using Enterprise Java tools.

The application tries to enable a low-cost, refurbished laptop seller to sell their products online, and was created as a learning tool for the developers in a university course.

Site is mildly unstable, and plans to refine errors are currently stalled. Perhaps I will revisit it someday and test out new features/work out old bugs.
